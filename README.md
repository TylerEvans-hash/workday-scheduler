# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
Simple calendar application that will allow the user to schedule out their day based on the hour. Based on the time of the day the scheduled appointments throughout the day will change color if the time is after the scheduled event.

## Goals for the Project ( User-Story )

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## The Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner

WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
